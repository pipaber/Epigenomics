## Methylation analysis

### Methylation

Epigenetics is the study of how your behaviors and environment can cause changes that affect the way your genes work. Unlike genetic changes, epigenetic changes are reversible and do not change your DNA sequence, but they can change how your body reads a DNA sequence (CDC,2024).

Talking about the genes, these can only be expressed when the chromatin is in it's relaxed form (euchromatin) and reversely, these cannot be expressed in it's compacted form (hetero-chromatin). Methylation of cytosine's control part of this process of the chromatin and it's really important to understand is a gene (or the surroundings) is methylated.

### CpG's

The cytosine's (C) that are methylated are followed by a guanine (G). This pattern is called CpG in the context of epigenetics. These CpG's tend to cluster into groups (CpG islands) and, these Cpg islands tend to be close to the promoter region of the genes.

### Bisulfite treatment

If a C is methylated the bisulfite treatment wonÂ´t change the cytosine but, if the C is not methylated, the C will suffer a transition to a T.

## Methyl-Seq

Analyzing bisulfite sequencing data requires a server or an HPC. U can use the *methylseq* pipeline from [nfcore](https://nf-co.re/methylseq/2.6.0) to get the .cov files to proced with the downstream analysis on R.

To see how to analyze Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) with the [@bsseq], click on the script below the image.
